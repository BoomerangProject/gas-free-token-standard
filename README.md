# GasFree Token Standard
Introducing the Gasfree Token Standard, which allows a third party to transfer tokens on behalf of another address, allowing third parties to subsidize gas costs while cryptographically ensuring the address which holds the tokens approves the transaction.

This Project will contain the contracts, documentation, and tests for the GasFree Token Standard.
